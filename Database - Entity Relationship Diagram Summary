entity relationship diagram (ERD) - a visual representation of the database structure.

It is easy to quickly identify what fields are in which tables and how the tables are related, including what are the relationships between each table,
whether is is one to one or one to many using the different arrows that connect each table


And ERD should have these
-Name of each table
-Name of fields  in each table
-Field data type, and whether or not it is nullable
-Identification of all primary and foreign key fields
-How each table is related to each other

They do not include data and only contains words that describe the table\

TABLES
At the top of each table is the primary key followed by the other fields

FIELDS
Each field has a name that is followed by whether its null or not and what data type it is
A field is basically a column where values will be stored in the database

KEYS
Identify the primary key at the top of the table using "PK"
In order to link the tables we need to connect the primary key to a foreign key
some tables will have foreign keys that link to a primary key table

RELATIONSHIPS
The link between tables is a relationship
Example class to student table
One class can have many students and one student can have many classes
This relationships between the tables can be represented by different arrows
