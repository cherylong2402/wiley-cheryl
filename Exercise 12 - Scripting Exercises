For each activity, save your working script to a text file named as:
cheryl-scripting-activity#.txt

##ACTIVITY 1
Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session – they need to know:
#What their username is
vi cheryl-scripting-activity1.txt
$USER

#What the current date is
date

#What the time is
date "+%T"

#What their current working directory is
pwd

#How many files they have in that directory
ls

#What is the biggest file in their current directory
du -sh

##ACTIVITY 2
#Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty). 
mkdir scriptactivity2
cd scriptactivity2
touch testfile1 testfile2 testfile3

#Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.
#!/bin/bash
for file in scriptactivity2
do
mv $file " "$($(date +'%y/%m/%d') "$file""


##ACTIVITY 3
You are in charge of creating a program for the lottery in your area! The options are for numbers between 1and 50. 
#Create a script that picks 5 for each draw plus a bonus ball number between 1 and 10. Output the numbers to a file that has the date in its name.
#!/bin/bash
RANDOM=$$
for i in `seq 5`
do
echo $(($RANDOM%51))
done

echo $((RANDOM%11))

set -o errexit
TODAY=`date +%Y.%m.%d`
lottery.date=~/$USER.man.$TODAY.log
exit 0


#Create another script that will allow users to check their lottery numbers and advise them if they match or not and how many matches they got.
#!/bin/bash
read line
list=(${line})
for i in (${line})
do
echo "you have input $i"

awk/$i/{print}'lottery.date>numbers.match
echo "The numbers above are those that match"
echo"The number of matches you got is"
wc -w/numbers.match
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 4
#Write a script to validate how secure someone's password is. Things you would care about:
Length should be 8 or more characters
The password should contain numbers and letters
There should be both uppercase and lowercase letters

#!/bin/bash
password=echo "Type your password"
read password
Len=$(echo ${#password})
if [$LEN -lt 8]; then
echo "$password is smaller than 8 characters"
fi
if [-z "$(printf "password | tr-d "[:alum:]")"]; then
printf "password does not contain letters and numbers"
else 
printf "password is secure"
fi
exit 0


##ACTIVITY 5
#Write a script that takes a number as an input and reverses it out to the user. For example, if the original number is 74985, the output should be 58947.
#! /bin/sh
n=echo "enter a number:"
read n
sd=0
rev=0
while [ $n -gt 0 ]
do
    sd=$(( $n % 10 ))
    rev=$(( $rev * 10 + $sd ))
    n=$(( $n / 10 ))
done
echo "Reverse number of entered digit is $rev"
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 6
#Create a script that takes two number parameters a and b and then shows True if a is larger than b or False otherwise.
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a value for a:"
read a
echo "Enter a value for b:"
read b
if [$a>$b] then echo "True"
else
echo "False"
fi
exit 0

#Create a second version of the script that then tells the user the difference between the two numbers.
#!/bin/bash
Diff=|$a-$b|
echo "The difference between the two numbers is $Diff"


##ACTIVITY 7
#Create a 10-question true or false quiz game in your script. Choose a topic of your liking for the questions!
#!/bin/bash
echo "Q1:The colour of banana is yellow(TRUE/FALSE)"
read answer
if [$answer=="TRUE"]
then echo "CORRECT"
else
echo "WRONG"
fi

echo "Q2:Watermelon is purple(TRUE/FALSE)"
read answer2
if [$answer2=="FALSE"]
then echo "CORRECT"
else
echo "WRONG"
fi
...


##ACTIVITY 8
#Create a script that completes the following tasks:
It prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry or enter another number.
When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
the product of the integers
the average of the integers
the sum of the integers
the min of the integers
the max of the integers
After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
the values the user entered
each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value

#!/bin/bash
for i in `seq 5`
do
echo "Enter an integer:"
read line
list=(${line})
for i in (${line})
do
echo "you have input $i"

((product=paste -sd* $line | bc))
((average=integer1+integer2+integer3+integer4+integer5/n))
((sum=paste -sd+ $line | bc))
((min=%d\n "${line[@]}" | sort -rn | tail -1))
((max=%d\n "${line[@]}" | sort -rn | head -1))
echo "Values entered are $line"
echo "Product of the integers is $product"
echo "Average of the integers is $average"
echo "sum of the integers is $sum"
echo "min of the integers is $min"
echo "max of the integers is $max"
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 9
#Write a script that takes a file name as a parameter.
#If the file exists, print an error and return a code.
#If the file does not exist, create the file.
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter file name:"
read file
if [-d $file]
then echo "error, file already exists"
else
`touch $file`
echo "File created"
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 10
#Write a script that writes random numbers to a file (one number per line).
The first parameter should be the file name.
The second parameter is the number of lines to write.
If the specified file already exists, display a relevant message and return a code.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter file name:"
read file
if [-d $file]
then echo "error, file already exists"
else
`touch $file`
numoflines=echo"enter number of lines to be generated:"
read n
RANDOM=$$
for i in `seq $n`
do 
echo $$RANDOM>$file
done
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 11
Create a file that includes the following numbers.
5 6 3 7 4 4 9 6 7 9 8 2 3 6 4 5 1 1 3 10 12
#Write a script that uses this file to perform the following tasks:
Read in the file
Sort the numbers into reverse order and output them to the screen
Each number should output exactly once. Duplicate numbers should not appear in the output.
#!/bin/bash
file='numbers.txt'
while read line
do
echo $line
sd=0
rev=0
while [ $line -gt 0 ]
do
    sd=$(( $line % 10 ))
    rev=$(( $rev * 10 + $sd ))
    line=$(( $line / 10 ))
done
echo "Reverse order of numbers is $rev"
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 12
#Write a script that checks if two files have at least one common element or not. Display an appropriate message for both scenarios. The file names should be specified as parameters. You will need to create the files to test this.
#!/bin/bash
list1='"Pig""Horse""Elephant""Rabbit""Snake""Lion"'
list2='"Rabbit""Giraffe""Lion""Rat""Fish"'
echo "Common elements are as listed below:"
grep -Fxf list 1 list 2
done
exit 0

##ACTIVITY 13
#Write a script that takes two files of unique numbers and displays the difference between the two lists (without using grep).
Stretch: Create a new script that does the same thing using grep. Which script runs faster?
For example:
File 1 contains:
1
2
4
6
File 2 contains:
1
2
89
6
7
The output should look like:
Only in file 1:
4

Only in file 2:
89
7

#!/bin/bash
diff -u file1 file2
echo "Only in file 1:"
comm -23 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)

echo "Only in file 2:"
comm -13 <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
exit 0

Stretch: diff "${file1}" "${file2} | grep "<"

##Activity 14
In the materials folder on the server you will find a file called books. Copy this file to your home directory.
cp books>/c/Users/chery

#Write a script that will parse the file, producing an output csv file that will list the word and each time it appears in the file.
#!/bin/bash
echo "enter word:"
read word
grep -i "$word" books | sort -n -r | head -n2 >books.csv
done
exit 0

Make sure the list is sorted in the file such that the most common word is listed at the top and then descending. For example, a couple of lines in the output file should look like this:
And,200
Is,195

##Activity 15
Imagine that you support the fix Generator script. Write a wrapper script to set up your environment properly. You can also edit the fixGenerator script if you need to.
Your fixGenerator script should be in a folder called FixGen in your home directory. The script needs to do the following:
Check for a folder called FixGen/logs and if not present create it
Compress all log files that are not the latest 3 logs files generated.
Run the FixGenerator script with the log file being generated into the FixGen/logs directory.
Once complete, add a cron job that will run Monday through Friday 6 a.m. to establish your environment.

#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter folder name:"
read file
if [-d $file]
then echo "error, folder already exists"
else
`touch $file`
tar -czvf
./fixGenerator.sh>FixGen/logs
00 06 ** Mon,Tues,Wed,Thurs,Fri /fixGenerator.sh


##Activity 16
#Write a script that will output a csv that could be loaded into ITRS Geneos for monitoring on your fixGen script.
It needs to parse the log file and produce a count of each message type that has been received or sent.
Ensure you distinguish in the csv file if the message was sent or received.
Also ensure you display the message type in English so it is easy to understand in monitoring. An example might look like:
Number of Partial fills,12

#!/bin/bash
grep -c sudo /var/log/file.log
echo "Number of Partial fills, $n">file.csv
exit 0


##Activity 17
Create a script to convert your fix log file into a useful csv.
Pull out the following information for each message:
If the fix tag is in the message, leave a blank in the csv so that it will load appropriately in Excel.
Translate the message type value into meaningful words.
Ensure you have a header row in your csv file:
Client, Message type, stock, quantity, price, side, order id, last quantity, exec id, last price 

#!/bin/bash
fix.log>details.csv
echo "Client", "Message type", "stock", "quantity", "price", "side", "order id", "last quantity", "exec id", "last price" > header.csv && cat details.csv >> header.csv && mv header.csv details.csv
exit 0

##Activity 18
Run the fixGenerator script to generate a fix log file.
Create a script to parse that log file and for each order create a text description of what happened with that order.
This should go into a log file with a paragraph for each order.
For example:
New buy order for apple with order id 12335, 100 shares at price 54.2 
Partial fill for apple with order id 12335, 20 shares at price 54.2
Cancel message for apple with order id 12335
Final state of order for apple with order id 12335: traded 40 shares at price 54.2. 
Remember that each time you run the fix generator script, it creates a new log file so this is a good way to test.

#!/bin/bash
./fixGenerator.sh>FixGen/logs
