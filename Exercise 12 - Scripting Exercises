For each activity, save your working script to a text file named as:
cheryl-scripting-activity#.txt

##ACTIVITY 1
Create a simple shell script to tell the user about their session â€“ they need to know:
#What their username is
vi cheryl-scripting-activity1.txt
$USER

#What the current date is
date

#What the time is
date "+%T"

#What their current working directory is
pwd

#How many files they have in that directory
ls

#What is the biggest file in their current directory
du -sh

##ACTIVITY 2
Create a directory with a few test files in it (the files can be empty). 
mkdir scriptactivity2
cd scriptactivity2
touch testfile1 testfile2 testfile3

Now write a script that for every file in that directory you rename it to have an extension of today's date in YYYYMMDD format.

##ACTIVITY 3
You are in charge of creating a program for the lottery in your area! The options are for numbers between 1and 50. 
#Create a script that picks 5 for each draw plus a bonus ball number between 1 and 10. Output the numbers to a file that has the date in its name.


#Create another script that will allow users to check their lottery numbers and advise them if they match or not and how many matches they got.
