ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability

These properties are put in place to ensure that failures do not happen in the database
Although it is not required, it risks big and important databases getting corrupted

ATOMIC
Atomicity ensures that if a database crashes, progress will not be lost and we can go back to where we were before
We either commit and complete the transaction completely or have no transaction at all until the error in one part is fixed
An example if when we are editing the database halfway and it crashes. This property allows the data to be restored when we come back to it.

CONSISTENCY
Besides enforcing consistency on the type and size of data allowed,
this property also ensures that all transactions and data are consistent. 
We cannot delete one thing in the database without first deleting something else as they affect each other 
and we also cannot add record codes that do not first exist in another table
For example we want to add a dog id to a store table
if this dog id does not first exist in the dog table, we cant add it to the store table.
This will be inconsistent and transaction fails

In the database each column is also assigned a unit whereby if we select number data type for a column we arent allowed to enter a word
This is to ensure consistent values in the same column


ISOLATION
This property ensures that two transactions do not interfere with each other
A transaction will not be displayed until a user is done with it as when all active transactions are being accessed and data is being changed 
at the same time it gets messy. Isolation ensures only when the transaction is complete then the other users can see it
For example if 2 users want to acess the same part of the database at the same time to edit records, only one is allowed to
Until the first user is done editing, the second user cannot see the changes he has made.


DURABILITY
This property ensures that once a transaction is finished and committed, it is durable such that any failures and crashes will not affect the saved transaction
The data is all safeguarded and saved permanently in the system
