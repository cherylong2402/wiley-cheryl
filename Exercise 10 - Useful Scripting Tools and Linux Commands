#Create a variable named TEXT with the value "The number is "
TEXT="The number is"

#Write a for loop that prints numbers 1-25 after printing the value of TEXT each time.
for i in {1:25}

done

#Run the same command, this time redirecting the output to a file named forloop.out.
touch forloop.out

#Write a sed command that creates a new output file from forloop.out where instead of saying "the number is ", it will now say "the number is not ". Name the file forloop2.out
forloop.out
sed 's/the number is/the number is not/g' forloop.out > newforloop.out

#Try running the following if statement to get familiar with it:
i=1
if(( $i==1 ))
then
echo "i is equal to 1"
elif(($i==2))
then
echo "i is equal to 2"
else
echo "i is neither 1 or 2"
fi

#Change the value of i to be something not 1 or 2 and check that the statement works again.

#Create a variable of today's date named TODAY in the format of DD.MM.YYYY.
TODAY=`date +%d.%m.%Y`

#Create another variable named GENDATE that has the command to generate and store the same date.
GENDATE=`date +%Y.%m.%d`

#Create a file named output.log with todayâ€™s date as an extension using the variable you just created.
touch output.log.$GENDATE

#Run the history command and put the output into a file named name.YYMMDD.module1112 in the directory specified by your instructor.
